### Drug virtual screening using quantum annealers
 - **Virtual screening is performed via Similarity Search**
 
 - **Molecules are converted to [Molecular graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_graph), and the problem is converted to finding the [Maximum Common Substructure (MCS)](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials/T006_compound_maximum_common_substructures.html) between two undirected graphs.**
 
 - **The MCS problem can be reformulated as a QUBO problem and solved in a quantum annealer.**
