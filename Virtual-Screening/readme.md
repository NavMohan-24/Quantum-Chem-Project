### Drug virtual screening using quantum annealers
 ** Virtual screening is performed via Similarity Search 
 ** Molecules are converted to [Molecular graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_graph) and the problem is converted to finding maximum common substructure (MCS) between two un-directed graphs.
 ** MCS problem can be reformulated as a QUBO problem and solved in a quantum annealer.
